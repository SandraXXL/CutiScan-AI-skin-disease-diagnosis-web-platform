## Introduction:
This is my first AI project, utilizing the InceptionV3 model trained on a dataset that merges resources from DermNet and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subirbiswas19/skin-disease-dataset. The dataset consists of 12 classes and 8000 images in total, splits into 80% for training and 20% for testing. The name "CutiScan" is derived from the Latin word "cutis," meaning "skin."

### The main functions are:  
1. Upload skin photo  
2. Crop photo  
3. Display possible results  
4. Classify 12 different skin diseases  
5. Provide detailed information on each skin disease

### Skin diseases included are:

acne, 
alopecia, 
athlete_foot, 
cellulitis, 
chickenpox, 
cutaneous_larva_migrans, 
impetigo, 
nail_fungus, 
ringworm, 
shingles, 
urticaria, 
vitiligo.

## Notes:
This project requires you to create a database "cutiscan" to store information regarding each disease. You can create such a database with "PHPMyAdmin", only one table with the name "disease" is needed in this project, here is the database structure:
